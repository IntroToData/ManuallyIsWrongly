# Understanding the Problem

**Question:*8 The freshman 15 - is it real or is it myth?

Using a data set of sampled freshman, what can we learn about the
dreaded freshman 15?

Consider:

- Distribution of weight gain/loss
    - Stratified by gender
- Is there a correlation between someone's starting weight and their
  delta?
  
# Distribution of weight gain/loss

```{r}

str(fifteen)

```

# Correlation: Weight Change ~ Starting Weight


```{r}

head(fifteen)

```
